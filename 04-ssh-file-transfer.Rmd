# Running programs on remote computers and retrieving the results

This two hour workshop will show attendees how to use remote computers
to run their analyses, work with the output files, and copy the
results back to their laptop and desktop computers. We will discuss
input and output formats, where files are usually read from and
written to, and how to use the ssh software to copy files to and from
remote computers.
