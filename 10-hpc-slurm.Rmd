# Executing large analyses on HPC clusters with slurm

This two hour workshop will introduce attendees to the slurm system
for using, queuing and scheduling analyses on high performance compute
clusters. We will also cover cluster computing concepts and talk about
how to estimate the compute resources you need and measure how much
youâ€™ve used.
