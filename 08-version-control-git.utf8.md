# Keeping track of your files with version control

This two hour workshop will show attendees how to use the git version
control system to track changes to your files on the remote system, as
well as backup your project files to github and transfer them to your
laptop or desktop. We will demonstrate file sharing via github, and
discuss ways to collaborate with a team.
