# Automating your analyses and executing long-running analyses on remote computers

This two hour workshop will show attendees how to automate their
analyses using shell scripts, as well as run and manage software that
takes minutes, hours, or days to execute. We’ll also show you how to
disconnect from and resume running processes using the ‘screen’
command.
