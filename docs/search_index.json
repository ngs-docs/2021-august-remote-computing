We will cover computing concepts, file systems and directory structure, and some of the most important commands for working with remote computers. Today and tomorrow we’ll be using an interactive Web site running on a binder. To start your binder, please click on the “launch” button below; it will take up to a minute to start. NOTE: This lesson was adapted from Data Carpentry’s Introduction to the Command Line for Genomics lesson and the Lab for Data Intensive Biology’s Advanced Beginner/Intermediate Shell workshop. 1.1 Introduction to UNIX 1.1.1 Learning Goals visualize file/directory structures understand basic shell vocabulary gain exposure to the syntax of shell &amp; shell scripting look at the contents of a directory find features of commands with man commands: pwd, ls, cd, man 1.1.1.1 What is the shell and what is the terminal? The shell is a computer program that uses a command line interface (CLI) to give commands made by your keyboard to your operating system. Most people are used to interacting with a graphic user interface (GUI), where you can use a combination of your mouse and keyboard to carry out commands on your computer. We can use the shell through a terminal program. Everything we can do using our computer GUI, we can do in the shell. We can open programs, run analyses, create documents, delete files and create folders. We should note that folders are called directories at the command line. For all intents and purposes they can be used interchangeably but if you’d like more information please see “The folder metaphor” section of Wikipedia. The ease of getting things done via the shell will increase with your exposure to the program. Go ahead and open a new terminal window in binder by clicking on “Terminal”. When we open up terminal in binder we will see a a line of text. This is a prompt statement. It can tell us useful things such as the name of the directory we are currently in, our username, or what computer we are currently running terminal on. Let’s take a look around. First, we can use the print working directory command see what directory we are currently located in. pwd This gives us the absolute path to the directory where we are located. An absolute path shows the complete series of directories you need to locate either a directory or a file starting from the root directory of your computer. What is the root? A useful way to start thinking about directories and files is through levels. At the highest level of your computer, you have the root directory. Everything that is contained in your computer is located in directories below your root directory. We can also look at the contents of the directory by using the ls (“list”) command: ls This command prints out a list of files and directories that are located in our current working directory. We’ve preloaded some data into the binder, so we have a subdirectory data/ that we can look at. To change the working directory, we need to use the cd (“change directory”) command. Let’s move into the data directory. cd data Let’s have a look around. ls We can see the following files: MiSeq Slide1.jpg hello.sh nano1.png README.md gvng.jpg nano2.png However, this directory contains more than the eye can see! To show hidden files we can use the -a option. ls -a We will see the following: . MiSeq Slide1.jpg hello.sh nano1.png .. README.md gvng.jpg .hidden nano2.png Three new items pop up ., .. and .hidden. Using options with our commands allows us to do a lot! But how did we know to add -a after ls? Most commands offer a --help. Let’s look at the available options that ls has: ls --help Here we see a long list of options. Each option will allow us to do something different. CHALLENGE Try to find the option that allows you to differentiate between directories and executable files when using ls. Hint: look for the word classify. (You can also look at the ls man page if you prefer! We can also combine commands: ls -aFl This combination of options will list all the contents of the directory and differentiate between file types. 1.2 Navigation 1.2.1 Learning Goals paths look at the contents of files perform functions outside of the directory you are in intro to the wildcard expression: * copy, move and remove files create and remove directories understand the structure of commands commands: cat, cp, mv, rm, mkdir Now we have seen how to navigate around our computers and seeing what is located in the directory we are. But some of the beauty of the shell is that we can execute activities in locations that we are not currently in. To do this we can either use an absolute path or a relative path. A relative path is the path to another directory from the the one you are currently in. Navigate into the tmp1 directory located in the .hidden directory. cd .hidden/tmp1 Here we see two files notit.txt and thisinnotit.txt. We can see what is in the directories using the cat command which concatenates and prints the content of the file we list. cat thisinnotit.txt This is not the text file you&#39;re looking for NOTE - you can use TAB to do filename completion, so if you type cat this and then press your Tab key once, it will autocomplete if there is a unique match. If there is more than one match, the first Tab will do nothing, and the second will show all the possible matches. Let’s see what else is in the other tmp directories: ls ../tmp2 and we can see the contents of tmp3 ls ../tmp3 So, even though we are in the tmp1/ directory, we can see what is in other directories by using the relative path to the directory of interest. Note we can also use absolute paths too. You may have noticed the ../ this is how to get to the directory above the one you are currently located in. Note: in this case, we have access to the RStudio file browser, too, which is really nice. But in the future we won’t. So we can use the file browser today, but on Farm we’ll have to get by with just the command line interface and no other interface! CHALLENGE: Use the absolute path to list the files in the tmp2 directory. Wouldn’t it be nice to see the contents of all the tmp directories at once? We can use a regular expression to capture a sequence of characters (like the numbers 1, 2 and 3 at the end of the tmp directories). We can use the wild card character *, which expands to match any amount of characters. ls ../tmp* ../tmp1: notit.txt thisinnotit.txt ../tmp2: anotherfile.txt ../tmp3: closebutnotit.txt youfoundit.txt So, even though we are in the tmp1 directory we can use a relative path. We are quite used to moving, copying and deleting files using a GUI. All of these functions can be carried out at the command line with the following commands: Copy files with the cp command by specifying a file to copy and the location of the copied file. Here we will copy the thisinnotit.txt into the file thisisacopy.txt. cp thisinnotit.txt thisisacopy.txt The syntax for the copy command is cp &lt;source_file&gt; &lt;destination_file&gt;. Using this syntax we can copy files to other directories as well: cp thisinnotit.txt ../tmp2 If we navigate to the tmp2 directory and list the files that are in it we will see the thisinnotit.txt file has been copied to the tmp2 directory. cd ../tmp2 ls -l CHALLENGE: Use the mv command to move the thisinnotit.txt file from tmp2 to tmp3. Once we know how to copy and move files, we can also copy and move directories. We can create new directories with the command mkdir. Let’s make a new directory called tmp4 cd ../ mkdir tmp4 ls -l The shell is quite powerful and can create multiple directories at once. It can create multiple directories in the current working directory: mkdir tmp5 tmp6 ls -l or it can create a series of directories on top of one another: mkdir -p how/deep/does/the/rabbit/hole/go We can use tab complete to get to the go directory. Type cd h then hit tab. If you hit tab enough times your command will eventually read: cd how/deep/does/the/rabbit/hole/go/ You can see that we’ve created a bit of a monster directory structure… CHALLENGE: Navigate to the data directory and use the rm command to remove the how directory and all its contents. This nicely hints at the power of the shell - you can do certain things (in this case, create a nested hierarchy of directories) much more easily in the shell. But that power cuts both ways - you can also mess things up more easily in the shell! 1.3 Viewing &amp; Searching 1.3.1 Learning Goals looking inside files search for keywords within files commands: less, head, tail, grep A big part of data science is making sure what you expect in a particular file is what you have in that file. There are a few ways to look at the contents of a file. We’ve already seen how to print the entirety of a file to the stdout of our cat command. We can also look at files using the less command. Less is a safe way of looking at the contents of a file without the ability to change it. (We’ll talk more about text files and editing them in the second workshop!) Starting from the data/ directory in our home directory cd ~/data/ let’s look at some sequence data in a fastq file format. cd MiSeq less F3D0_S188_L001_R1_001.fastq We can see a bunch of sequence data! Use the up, down, left and right arrows to look through the folder a bit. Then press q to quit less. A lot of the time we want to know if a file contains what we expect. Many of the sequence files in this directory have the file ending .fastq. We expect these files to contain information in a particular format throughout the file with four lines of information for each sequence string. Looking through a million line file using less will take a long time. Rather than manually looking through the file we can print only a portion of the files contents to the terminal: head F3D0_S188_L001_R1_001.fastq @M00967:43:000000000-A3JHG:1:1101:18327:1699 1:N:0:188 NACGGAGGATGCGAGCGTTATCCGGATTTATTGGGTTTAAAGGGTGCGTAGGCGGCCTGCCAAGTCAGCGGTAAAATTGCGGGGCTCAACCCCGTACAGCCGTTGAAACTGCCGGGCTCGAGTGGGCGAGAAGTATGCGGAATGCGTGGTGTAGCGGTGAAATGCATAGATATCACGCAGAACCCCGATTGCGAAGGCAGCATACCGGCGCCCTACTGACGCTGAGGCACGAAAGTGCGGGGATCAAACAG + #&gt;&gt;AABABBFFFGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHGGGHHHHHGHGGGGGGGHGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHGGGGGHHHHGHGGGGGGHHBGHGDGGGGGHHHGGGGHHHHHHHHGGGGGHG@DHHGHEGGGGGGBFGGEGGGGGGGG.DFEFFFFFFFDCFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFDFDFFFEFFCFF?FDFFFFFFFFAFFFFFFFFFFFBDDFFFFFEFADFFFFFBAFFFA?EFFFBFF @M00967:43:000000000-A3JHG:1:1101:14069:1827 1:N:0:188 TACGGAGGATGCGAGCGTTATCCGGATTTATTGGGTTTAAAGGGTGCGTAGGCGGCCTGCCAAGTCAGCGGTAAAATTGCGGGGCTCAACCCCGTACAGCCGTTGAAACTGCCGGGCTCGAGTGGGCGAGAAGTATGCGGAATGCGTGGTGTAGCGGTGAAATGCATAGATATCACGCAGAACCCCGATTGCGAAGGCAGCATACCGGCGCCCTACTGACGCTGAGGCACGAAAGTGCGGGGATCAAACAG + 3AA?ABBDBFFBEGGEGGGGAFFGGGGGHHHCGGGGGGHFGHGGCFDEFGGGHGGGEGF1GGFGHHHHHGGEGGHHHHHFGGGGGGHHHHHGGGGCDDGHHGGGFHHHHHHHHCD@CCHGGGGHEHGGG@GFGGGGGGG@BGGGEGCEBFFFBFFB;9@EFFFEFFFFFFFFFFFFAFBBBFFFFFBBBFFFFBBBFFFFFFFFFFFBBBBBBBFFFFFFFFFDDFAFFFFF.AF9/FBBBBB.EAFFE?F @M00967:43:000000000-A3JHG:1:1101:18044:1900 1:N:0:188 TACGGAGGATGCGAGCGTTGTCCGGAATCACTGGGCGTAAAGGGCGCGTAGGCGGTTTAATAAGTCAGTGGTGAAAACTGAGGGCTCAACCCTCAGCCTGCCACTGATACTGTTAGACTTGAGTATGGAAGAGGAGAATGGAATTCCTAGTGTAGCGGTGAAATGCGTAGATATTAGGAGGAACACCAGTGGCGAAGGCGATTCTCTGGGCCAAGACTGACGCTGAGGCGCGAAAGCGTGGGGAGCAAACA head prints the first ten lines of a file out onto your screen.

Another useful thing to do is to be able to search the contents of files for a particular string of characters you would like to find. Let’s say you’d like to find the sequence CATTAG in your files. We can use the file pattern searcher grep to look for our favorite sequence: grep CATTAG F3D0_S188_L001_R2_001.fastq We can also use the wildcard regular expression to search CATTAG in all of the fastq files located in our current working directory: grep CATTAG *.fastq CHALLENGE: What line does CATTAG occur on in F3D141_S207_L001_R1_001.fastq? (HINT: Use grep --help to search for grep options related to line number) 1.4 File Manipulation 1.4.1 Learning Goals commands for, basename, echo 1.4.2 Renaming a bunch of files Let’s make sure we’re in the right directory- the one that contains all of our data files. cd ~/data/MiSeq For our first task, let’s pretend that we want to rename all of the fastq files to be .fq files instead (this is a surprisingly useful specific skill, even if you can’t immediately think of why you would want to do that!). Here, we get to use two of my favorite commands - ‘for’ and ‘basename’. for lets you do something to every file in a list. To see it in action: for i in *.fastq do echo $i done This is running the command echo for every value of the variable ‘i’, which is set (one by one) to all the values in the expression *.fastq. If we want to get rid of the extension ‘.fastq’, we can use the basename command: for i in *.fastq do basename $i .fastq done Now, this doesn’t actually rename the files - it just prints out the name, with the suffix ‘.fastq’ removed. To rename the files, we need to capture the new name in a variable: for i in *.fastq do newname=$(basename $i .fastq).fq echo $newname done What $( ... ) does is run the command in the middle, and then replace the $( ) with the output of running the command. Now we have the old name ($i) and the new name ($newname) and we’re ready to write the rename command – for i in *.fastq do newname=$(basename $i .fastq).fq echo mv $i $newname done Question: why did I put echo here? Now that we’re pretty sure it all looks good, let’s run it for realz: for i in *.fastq do newname=$(basename $i .fastq).fq mv $i $newname done and voila, we have renamed all the files! Side note: you may see backquotes used instead of $(...). It does the same thing but is trickier to get right, so we teach $(...) instead of `. 1.5 Some final notes This lesson focused on file and directory exploration because that’s something everyone needs to know, and all these commands will work on pretty much any computer that is running a UNIX compatible shell (including Mac OS X and Windows Subsystem for Linux). We’ll get into a broader range of tasks soon, promise! The binder and this documentation page will stay working for the foreseeable future, so please feel free to come back and revisit some of these commands! We will explore more UNIX commands over the next few workshops! Google (and especially stackoverflow) is your friend! Use Internet search whenever you have questions about what a command does, or what commands to use to achieve a particular tasks.

We will discuss files and content types, and cover the most common ways to work with remote text files. As with the first workshop introducing the UNIX command line, we’ll be using an interactive Web site running on a binder. To start your binder, please click on the “launch” button below; it will take up to a minute to start. Once it’s launched, go to the “Terminal” tab. 2.1 Text files vs other files Text files are a fairly narrow but very important subset of the kinds of files that we will work with in data science. Text files are, loosely defined, files that are human-readable without any special machine interpretation needed - such as text-only e-mails, CSV files, configuration files, and Python and R scripts. The list above is interesting, because it makes the point that just because a human can “read” the files doesn’t mean that they are intended for humans, necessarily. For example, CSV files can be more or less strictly defined in terms of formatting, and Python and R scripts still need to be valid Python or R code. DNA sequence data files like we saw yesterday are another case in point - it’s pretty rare (and a bad idea) to edit them manually, but you could if you really wanted to. The operational distinction really comes down to this: text files can be created, edited, changed, and otherwise manipulated with text-format based tools, like text editors, grep (which we saw yesterday), and other programs. Text files are a common and standard format that many tools can interact with. In comparison, binary files are files that need special programs to interact with them. Some of them are more standard than others - for example, Word files can be read or written by many programs. Images (JPG and PNG and…) can be manipulated by many programs as well. Zip files are another semi-standard format that can be manipulated by several different programs. The main thing is that you can’t just look at them with standard text-focused tools - and typically this is because binary files are meant to be used for different kinds of data than text. As a side note, one of the most important aspects of text files is that there are some really powerful tools for tracking changes to them, and collaboratively editing them - we’ll cover that in workshop 8, version control! 2.1.1 OK, OK, what does this all mean in practice? Let’s look at a simple text file - 2cities/README.md: cat 2cities/README.md As you may remember, ‘cat’ (short for ‘catenate’) displays the content of the file. This is a file in a format called Markdown, that is a lightly decorated text file with a title and so on. While it can be nicely formatted by an interpreting program (see the way github renders this file!, it can also just be viewed and read with cat. This is different from the other file in 2cities/; take a look at what’s there by running, ls 2cities/ and you should see README.md book.txt.gz In this directory, there is one text file and one binary file. If you want to see if it’s a file type that UNIX recognizes you can run the file command, e.g. file 2cities/README.md will report that it’s ASCII text, while file 2cities/book.txt.gz will report that it’s “gzip compressed data”, which is a compressed data type. What do we do with that? 2.1.2 Working with gzipped files gzip is a common type of file, and all that it means is that it’s been compressed (made smaller) with the gzip program. Look at it’s file size first – ls -lh 2cities/book.txt.gz and you’ll see that it’s about 300k. You can uncompress a gzip file with gunzip; in this case, gunzip 2cities/book.txt.gz will produce 2cities/book.txt CHALLENGE: what two commands will tell you the file type and size of 2cities/book.txt? Yep, it’s almost 3 times bigger when it’s uncompressed! And it’s file type is “UTF-8 Unicode (with BOM) text, with CRLF line terminators” which is a fancy way of saying “text, supporting extended characters (unicode), and with both a carriage return (CR) and a line feed (LF) at the end of each line.” The important thing is that pretty much any text editor should be able to edit this kind of file. Let’s take a quick look at the beginning of the file with head: head 2cities/book.txt yep, looks like text! 2.1.3 Digression: file extensions are often meaningful (but don’t have to be) Couldn’t we have guessed at what these files were based on their names? Yes, the .md extension usually means it’s a text file with Markdown formatting, and the .gz extension typically means it’s a compressed file, and the .txt extension typically means it’s a text file. So you can read book.txt.gz to mean that it’s a text file that’s been compressed. But this isn’t guaranteed - it’s a convention, rather than a requirement. Many programs will actively “sniff” the file type by looking at the content (which is what file does), and you should never blindly trust the file type indicated by the extension. 2.1.4 Let’s edit this file! Let’s start with the nano editor. nano and its sibling pico are simple text editors that let you get started, but are ultimately limited in their functionality. Note: If you’ve ever used the ‘pine’ e-mailer, you’ve used these editors! nano (and all of the editors we’ll use below in the terminal) are “text graphics” editors that give you a visual interface that is not the command line (which is good, trust us) but that also exist only within the terminal program and do not support mouse movements. This is important - you can’t use the mouse to move the cursor or make changes (although you can select things). 2.1.5 Running the editor and exiting/saving To get started, let’s open the file: nano 2cities/book.txt this will put you in an editor window. First things first: you can immediately exit by typing CTRL-X (that’s holding down the CTRL key, and then typing X, lowercase or uppercase - no shift key is needed. If you haven’t changed anything, it will simply exit. Now edit the file with nano again (use the up arrow on the command line to find and rerun the previous command!) – nano 2cities/book.txt Now change something - just type. You should see the new characters added. Use CTRL-X again, and it will ask “Save modified buffer?” If you say “No”, it will not save; if you type ‘y’, it will ask you for the name of the file. Just hit ENTER to overwrite the file you edited here. Now, you should be back at the command line. Run: head 2cities/book.txt and you should see your changes! Note, there’s no ‘undo’ possible once you’ve saved. 2.1.6 Navigating in nano Let’s go back into nano and learn how to move around. Run: nano 2cities/book.txt and use the arrow keys to move up and down and left and right. For big files, this can be tedious! If you look down on the bottom, you can see a bunch of help text telling you what control+keys to use - use CTRL-V to page down, and CTRL-Y to page back up. 2.1.7 Long lines - note! One of my least favorite features of nano is the way it handles long lines (lines that extend off the right of the screen). Try making one - go to the end of a line, and add a bunch of text. What it does is shift the whole line left while you’re typing, and then when you scroll back over to the left, it puts a $ at the last column on the screen to tell you that it’s a long line. Very confusing. But there you are. 2.1.8 Slightly more advanced features ^K will delete the current line, and ^U will put the last deleted line into the current location. (It’s a slightly janky version of cut and paste that many editors use in UNIX, for some reason.) 2.1.9 Getting help! In nano, CTRL-G will put you in “help” mode, and you can now navigate around (CTRL-V and CTRL-Y to read), and then CTRL-X to exit. Note again that ^ in front of a key means control, so e.g. ^K means “type CTRL+K” (which will delete the current line). Note also that M- means “hit Escape and then the key after”, so pressing the “escape” key, letting go of it, and then hitting “g” will go to a line and column number. Try it out - type Escape, then g, then type 500,10 and hit enter. Why do CTRL and Escape work differently? You hold down CTRL and another key, but you press Escape and then type something. Why!? The answer is that CTRL and ALT are “modifier keys”, like SHIFT - they modify the character sent when you hold them down. Escape is its own character, however, so you’re first saying “here’s an escape character!” and then “here’s another character!” (We don’t make the rules, we just explain them - sorry!) 2.1.10 Challenges: Use the help screen to answer (and experiment with) the following challenges - remember, CTRL-G gets you into help, CTRL-V pages down, and CTRL-X exits help. CHALLENGE: How do you delete the character at the current cursor position? CHALLENGE 2: How do you move to the end of the file? You can do a lot in these but as soon as you’re dealing with really large files, or many files, we suggest other editors. That having been said, we teach nano because it’s a good “basic” editor that is usually available and can almost always be used if you don’t have access to your favorite editor. 2.2 Big Powerful Editors There are two fairly dominant editors that work at the command line. They’ve been around for decades, and they have many advocates who care for them with a near-religious fervor. We will demo them for you, and point you at learning resources for them, and then leave it up to you to pick one. (We’ll probably use nano for most of the work we do in these workshops.) 2.2.1 Big Powerful Editor 1: vi ‘vi’ stands for “visual editor” and it’s available on most systems. It’s incredibly powerful, and incredibly robust, and is correspondingly cryptic and hard to use. It involves a lot of remembering specific character commands, in particular. (We’re actually using ‘vim’, but never mind that - it’s compatible with vi. Read more here.) To run vi, type: vi 2cities/book.txt (You should see all your changes from before, right?) vi starts in “normal mode”, which allows you to navigate around the file. In normal mode, what you type does not change the file - instead, it lets you issue commands to vi. The first and most important (?) command - to exit, type: :q and if there are no changes, it will simply exit. Run vi again, and let’s edit – vi 2cities/book.txt and then type ‘i’ to go to “insert” mode, and type something. Then hit the escape key to go back to “normal” mode. Now try to exit with :q. It won’t work! You have to either save, or quit. To force-quit without saving, run :q!. Now let’s learn to save! Go back and edit (i, then type something, then escape). To save, type :wq. (You can also (mystifyingly) type ZZ to do the same thing. shrug.) The main thing that vi does is give you a “normal” mode (where you can navigate around - use CTRL-F and CTRL-V to page down and up, for example) and an edit mode (use ‘i’ for insert or ‘a’ for append) where what you type goes directly into the file. You use Escape to get out of edit mode. In normal mode, ‘x’ will delete the character you’re on, and ‘dd’ will delete the line you’re on (and put it in the cut buffer), and P will pull the line out of the cut buffer into the file at the current location. And that’s what you really need to know :). A few tips for normal mode - to get help, type :help to go to a specific line, type the line number followed by G. 500G As a side note, we’ve just taught you the single most asked question on the Internet about UNIX: how to exit vi!! 2.2.2 Big Powerful Editor 2: emacs The other editor to know about is emacs. (This is what Titus uses the most.) To run emacs, emacs 2cities/book.txt This is automatically in edit mode (there’s no normal mode) so it behaves kind of like nano. To exit emacs, type CTRL-X and then CTRL-C. If you’ve modified things (by typing something), it will ask you if you want to save. To page down, type CTRL-V. To page up, type Escape V. To go to the beginning of a line, type CTRL-A. End of line, CTRL-E. (I’m telling you these specific keys because they also work at the command line.) There’s a pretty nice interactive tutorial for via that you can access with CTRL-H t (CTRL-H, followed by a ‘t’). Emacs shines when editing multiple files, but it can do a lot more, too. Some people spend their entire computing lives in emacs… see, for example, org-mode. 2.2.3 An opinion You only need to learn nano, and be basically familiar with vi and emacs. Read on for why! 2.3 Remote vs local, and why editors? So we’ve just shown you a bunch of editors that work on the command line/in the Terminal window, but don’t support mouse and copy paste and multiple windows and other nice things. Why can’t you just always use a nice editor that supports mouse commands etc etc?? Well. There are a few reasons! First is that it’s always nice to have backup options. Even if you resolutely stick with something that runs on your laptop, every now and then you may find yourself in a situation where you’re using someone else’s computer to debug or demonstrate something. Second is that these are platform independent options, in some sense - if you are connected to a UNIX system, you can pretty much always use nano or vi or emacs, no matter how you are connecting or from what type of computer. Third, sometimes it’s just faster to fix something locally in the shell. And it’s nice to have the option. Fourth, and related, is that remote file editing from your laptop or desktop requires that certain things be available on the remote computer - ssh and authentication (see next two workshops, Workshops 3 and 4!). Unfortunately, these aren’t always available - for example, we can’t actually use the nice editors on this binder, for technical reasons; we’d have to use the RStudio editor (which is also nice, but is also not always available). Last and probably least, if you’re in the Matrix and you’re Trinity and you’re trying to hack through the machine firewall after breaking into a heavily guarded compound, you’re unlikely to want to take the time to install an editor on a laptop you bring with you. Better to be able to use what’s already on the system, eh? (Yes, this is a Matrix reference.) 2.4 Editors that run locally on your laptop/desktop That all having been said, there is no reason you can’t use nice friendly editors most of the time! I asked on twitter about what editors people liked, and several popped up - Visual Studio Code was a hands-down winner. It works on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux, and is free. BBEdit was beloved by many. Runs on Mac OS X. Free, with pay option. NotePad++ is a nice free Windows editor that I’ve used in the distant past. Some people really liked Atom too, which is free and runs on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. Any or all of these will work for editing remote files, support a wide variety of languages nicely, and otherwise are excellent choices. Pick one! Thrive! (We can’t use these yet because we need to configure remote access in a particular way - that will come next week :).) 2.5 Thinking about editors as a means to an end At the end of the day, whatever editor you choose needs to be one that lets you achieve your end goal - which is to quickly and reliably edit text files. I personally switch between vi and emacs on a regular basis. Emacs is where I do long-form writing and editing (because I’ve got mine configured nicely for that), while vi is what I use for quick edits (because it’s fast to start, and I don’t need to configure it at all for it to be useful - so I can use it more places). Again, most people will probably end up using something like VScode, which got many rave reviews online and supports robust syntax highlighting and many different languages, as well as remote editing. But it really doesn’t matter. I think of an editor like a kitchen - you may customize your kitchen layout and tools differently from someone else, but at the end of the day, your goal is to cook something, and you (in this analogy) only really need to worry about another editor if you’re using an unfamiliar system, just like if you’re cooking in a strange kitchen. And then it will be maddening and infuriating but that’s ok :). 2.6 Other ways to create, edit, filter, and modify files So editing is pretty cool, but if you’re in a hurry, or want to make a small change without switching windows, or need to work with some pretty big files, there are other approaches you can use. Read on! 2.6.1 Redirection, appending, and piping. By default, many UNIX commands like cat send output to something called standard out, or “stdout”. This is a catch-all phrase for “the basic place we send regular output.” (There’s also standard error, or “stderr”, which is where errors are printed; and standard input, or “stdin”, which is where input comes from.) Much of the power of the UNIX command line comes from working with stdout output, and if you work with UNIX a lot, you’ll see characters like &gt; (redirect), &gt;&gt; (append) and | (pipe) thrown around. These are redirection commands that say, respectively, “send stdout to a new file”, “append stdout to an existing file”, and “send stdout from one program to another program’s stdin.” Let’s start by going to our home directory: cd ~/ 2.6.2 The simplest possible “editor” - echo You can create a file with echo and redirection, like so: echo this is some content &gt; file.txt which will put the words this is some content in the file named file.txt. CHALLENGE: how do you view the contents of file.txt? If you then run echo this is other content &gt; file.txt it will overwrite file.txt. (Note: if you don’t like this overwriting behavior, you can run set -o noclobber so that bash will complain.) Instead of overwriting, you can append by specifying &gt;&gt;, like so – echo more content &gt;&gt; file.txt This doesn’t just work with echo - you can do this with many UNIX commands, e.g. cat file.txt file.txt &gt; newfile.txt will create newfile.txt with two copies of file.txt in it, and you can add a third with cat file.txt &gt;&gt; newfile.txt You can also e.g. search for words with grep and then save the results – for example, this will search for the word “worst” in the Tale of Two Cities, and save the results to worst-lines.txt. grep worst 2cities/book.txt &gt; worst-lines.txt 2.6.3 Piping and filtering What if you wanted to count the number of lines in which the word worst shows up in the Tale of Two Cities? You could use the “wc” (wordcount) program - grep worst 2cities/book.txt &gt; worst-lines.txt wc -l worst-lines.txt (the answer is 18 :) but this creates an unnecessary intermediate file, worst-lines.txt. You can avoid creating this file by using piping: grep worst 2cities/book.txt | wc -l which says “send the output of grep to the input of wordcount”. You’ll see this a lot in UNIX, and below we’ll explore this on a new file type - CSV files! 2.7 Working with CSV files CSV files - Comma Separated Value files - are another very common type of text files, especially in data science. Let’s explore working with them! We’ve put a list of South Park TV show quotes under SouthParkData/All-seasons.csv.gz. Let’s change into that directory to work with the CSV file. cd ~/SouthParkData Let’s now uncompress the file – remember, you can use Tab completion here by typing gunzip A&lt;TAB&gt; – gunzip All-seasons.csv.gz and look at the first few rows of the result All-seasons.csv file – head All-seasons.csv It looks like there are four columns, and the quotes are multi-line quotes. (I’ve never seen this before, but it seems to work!) Suppose you want to see if the word ‘computer’ is in there anywhere. You can use grep to do that – grep computer All-seasons.csv – and you get a lot of results! First, let’s count them: grep computer All-seasons.csv | wc -l – this will count the number of lines the word ‘computer’ shows up on. (It’s 78.) If you browse through the file, you might release that ‘Computer’ is a character on the show, but it turns out that grep is really literal and doesn’t match ‘Computer’ when you search for ‘computer’ - you need to provide ‘grep’ with ‘-i’ to do case-insensitive search! Let’s try that – grep -i computer All-seasons.csv | wc -l – and now it’s 101. How would we get at just the lines spoken by the computer? Well, if you look at the header of the file, head All-seasons.csv you’ll see that the third column is the one with the character in it. You can use the cut command to pick out just the third column by specifying comma as a separator with -d and -f3 as the field number – cut -d, -f3 All-seasons.csv | grep Computer which will give you a manageable number of results - about 16. You might note that there is an inconsistency in the way the character is named - Computer vs Computer Voice (maybe these are different characters? I don’t watch enough South Park to know…) Let’s do some counting – cut -d, -f3 All-seasons.csv | grep Computer | sort | uniq -c This is hard to pull apart but let’s do so - first, cut out column 3 then, search for Computer then, sort them alphabetically then, count the number of times each character shows up There are lots of ways this can come in handy for digging into csv files and figuring out where values are wonky. 2.7.1 Use csvtk when working with CSV files, maybe. This section was mostly to show you other ways of interacting with generic text files with CSV as an example, but if you work a lot with CSV or TSV files, I wanted to suggest looking into the csvtk program – we’ll show you how to install it with conda in workshop 5, but we pre-installed it for you on this binder. With csvtk, you can run commands that make use of column headers - for example, csvtk cut -f Character All-seasons.csv | grep Computer | sort | uniq -c gives you the same output, but it uses the header name. csvtk is a really nice piece of software that I am starting to use heavily. Highly recommended when doing a lot of CSV/TSV work - definitely check out the manual. 2.8 A quick primer on compression. Make sure you’re in the SouthParkData directory and have uncompressed All-seasons.csv – cd ~/SouthParkData gunzip All-seasons.csv (it’s ok if you’ve already run these and they fail, just want to make sure!) Text files can be large, so often they are distributed in compressed version. 2.8.1 Gzip and .gz files. gzip is a common compression format that works with .gz files. It works with one file at a time, so gzip compresses that one file and makes a new .gz file. To compress All-seasons.csv with gzip, you can use: gzip All-seasons.csv If you try to run it again, you’ll get an error message; try it! gzip All-seasons.csv …because the file no longer exists - it’s been compressed into a new file, All-seasons.csv.gz! If you run gunzip, it will uncompress the file and delete the old one. Sometimes this isn’t what you want – you can use output redirection to uncompress it and make a new copy: gunzip -c All-seasons.csv.gz &gt; All-seasons.csv but, then, if you try to run gzip All-seasons.csv it will tell you that the .gz file already exists. Say ‘n’ or use CTRL-C to exit. 2.8.2 zip and compressing multiple files. The big downside to gzip is that it works one file at a time. What if you wanted to bundle up multiple files AND compress them? Our recommended approach is to use zip to build a zip bundle or archive. This will both compress files, and store multiple files (even a directory hierarchy!) First, create the archive - cd ~/ zip -r south-park.zip SouthParkData/ (the -r is needed on some versions of zip to package up directories.) Then make a copy in a new place (just to demonstrate that it all works :) - mkdir new-place/ cd new-place/ unzip ../south-park.zip ls -R and you will see a complete new copy under ~/new-place/south-park/SouthParkData. This is handy for making quick backup copies of things and downloading them (see Workshop 4!) as well as sending people collections of files. We’ll show you a different way, using version control, in Workshop 8. Note, you can use unzip -v to see what’s in a zip archive, unzip -v ../south-park.zip and selectively unzip specific files by specifying them on the command line like so: unzip ../south-park.zip SouthParkData/README.md 2.9 Concluding thoughts What we’ve shown you is a whole plethora of hopefully not-too-confusing options for editing and working with text files. In terms of editing, the only thing you really need to do is (1) bookmark this page when you need to figure out how to exit vi, and (2) remember to use nano! The redirection and compression stuff is really useful, but again, you just need to know it exists and that there’s this tutorial on it. Taking a step back, these first two workshops have been about introductory skills that you will use every day when you use a UNIX computer. These skills may seem confusing, but they will become second nature if you use them regularly. And we’ll be doing that through the next 9 workshops! "],["connecting-to-remote-computers-with-ssh.html", "3 Connecting to remote computers with ssh 3.1 SSH and Clients 3.2 Mac OS X: Using the Terminal program 3.3 Windows: Connecting to remote computers with MobaXterm 3.4 Logging out and logging back in. 3.5 You’re logged on to a remote computer. Now what? 3.6 Copying files to and from your local computer. 3.7 Some commands are available! Others are not. 3.8 Summing up file transfer - a challenge! 3.9 Summing things up", " 3 Connecting to remote computers with ssh This two hour workshop will show attendees how to connect to remote computers using ssh software, which is the most common way to do so. We will discuss usernames and passwords, introduce ssh software clients, and work through the most common challenges attendees will face in connecting to remote computers. 3.1 SSH and Clients We’re going to be using SSH, the Secure Shell protocol, to connect to a remote computer - in this case, the ‘farm’ computer at UC Davis. We’ll use it for the next 7 workshops, and then in workshop 11, we’ll use ssh to connect to a computer that we rent from Amazon instead. ssh is a standard way to connect to remote computers, both to run commands and to retrieve files. It uses an encrypted connection so nothing you type can be seen by anyone else, which protects your passwords as well as any other data you send. 3.1.1 Some security thoughts A few points on the security front - you still need to use a secure authentication method (password, or private key - we’ll show you that in workshop 4!) people can still look over your shoulder, and if they have access to your computer they can do things like install keyloggers. ssh doesn’t hide the fact that you’re communicating with a particular remote computer, which is sometimes what snoopers care about (e.g. nation-states) But, by and large, security for researchers is not about stealing your data, it’s about breaking into the remote computers for other reasons. ssh is a pretty good protection against network eavesdroppers and so on. 3.1.2 ssh as a protocol - many clients! ssh operates as a network “protocol”, which means that the sender (your local computer, in this case) and the receiver (the farm computer) can be running any software that “speaks” ssh, and they can communicate just fine. In particular, this means you can use many different software packages that speak ssh - known as ssh “clients” - and we link to some below. For our lessons, we’re going to use two specific ssh clients, one for Mac OS X that’s just called “ssh”, and one for Windows that’s called MobaXterm. We’ve chosen these because ssh comes with Mac OS X, so we don’t need to install it, and we have a lot of experience with MobaXterm. Unfortunately they’re (mostly) quite different in appearance, so we’re going to run through them separately the first time through. There are many alternatives - for example, for Mac OS X there are many different free SSH clients, and here is a list of 10 ssh clients for Windows. They will all look and feel somewhat different, but they will all get you the same place! Windows users: While we’re working through the Mac OS X ssh connection, please go to the Windows instructions and start downloading MobaXterm - thanks!. 3.2 Mac OS X: Using the Terminal program Find and open the Terminal program using Spotlight - it’s under Applications. It will look and feel a lot like the things you saw in Workshops 1 and 2 :). (Congratulations! You have unlocked a secret of Mac OS X - it’s got a command line underneath, because it’s actually a UNIX operating system!) Now type ssh datalab-XX@farm.cse.ucdavis.edu where you replace XX with your user number (between 10 and 60). (You should received an e-mail from “Titus Brown” with the subject “Farm account name (remote computing 2021 workshop series)”. Ask a TA for help if you can’t find this e-mail.) You will be confronted with a “password:” prompt. Copy and paste in the password from your farm account e-mail. Ask a TA for help if you need it! Note that the password does not display, so it will look like nothing is being entered when you paste.) And voila, you are now logged into farm! You should be at a prompt that looks like this: datalab-09@farm:~$ 3.3 Windows: Connecting to remote computers with MobaXterm Steps: Go to the MobaXterm download page. Select “Home Edition”. Select “Portable edition”. It’s 25 MB and will take about a minute to download. Find the downloaded Zip file in your Downloads folder (should be named “MobaXterm_Personal_21.2”), and double click on it. In the MobaXterm_Personal_21.2 folder, run the MobaXterm 21.2 Application. Note: You may need to “allow access on all networks for this application” if Windows asks. Click on Session… (upper left). In the new window, click on SSH (upper left). Under “Basic SSH settings”, set “Remote host” to “farm.cse.ucdavis.edu”. This is the computer name you are connecting to. Click on “specify username”, and enter the username you received in the e-mail from “Titus Brown” with the subject “Farm account name (remote computing 2021 workshop series)”. (Ask a TA for help if you can’t find this e-mail.) Then select OK. It will now open up a terminal-looking window that will ask for your password. Select your password from your e-mail and copy it (ask a TA for help if you can’t find your password). Then use right-click to paste it. (It may open a pop-up window asking what you want right-click to do. Select the default.) Hit enter, and it should log you in! Congratulations! It will probably ask you if you want to store the password in your password store, and then ask you for a master password. You can then use this master password to “unlock” all your ssh passwords for MobaXterm to use. You can pick something short and simple to remember since (at least for now) you’ll only be using it to log into the temporary account at farm, but if you end up using MobaXterm a lot you may want to change it. 3.4 Logging out and logging back in. OK. Now that you’re in, …log out and log back in! To log out, type ‘logout’. Then go back through the above to make sure you’ve got it all right. A few notes - for Mac OS X, you can use the up arrow to go to the previous command and run it. You’ll need to type your password in again, though. for MobaXterm, you’ll be able to do use the saved password so you won’t need to type your password in again; see the screenshot below. 3.5 You’re logged on to a remote computer. Now what? The magic of UNIX and the command line is that once you’re logged onto a remote computer, …everything works the same. Yes, you will have access to different files, and maybe different software, and different compute resources (more disk space, maybe more CPUs or more memory) but the command line basically works the same whether you’re logged in to your laptop, a workstation next door, or an HPC across the world. Let’s start by reprising some of the basics from workshop 1 (the command line) and workshop 2 (editing text files). 3.5.1 Welcome to your account! Start by running: pwd and you will see something like /home/ctbrown, although it will vary with the account name you used. This is because we’re all using different accounts with different default home directories. 3.5.2 Loading some files into your account Before we go any further, we need some files! You’ll note that if you do an ls, there’s nothing in your home directory. That’s because most UNIX accounts start out empty. (Sometimes there will be generic files like “Desktop” and so on in there - it depends on the system.) Well, actually, it’s not quite empty. Try: ls -la and you’ll see a few configuration files and directories. All of these are created automatically for you and you don’t need to worry about them for now. So, basically, your account is empty of user files. So let’s get some files! There are actually many ways to download files, and we’ll show you a few over the next few workshops. We’ll start by mimicking the setup of the binders on days 1 and 2 by copying a bunch of files from GitHub into your account. The following command will take the set of files here and make them appear in your account: git clone https://github.com/ngs-docs/2021-remote-computing-binder/ – note that git and GitHub are something we’ll cover more thoroughly in week 8. For now, just accept it as one way to go out and get files :). Now if you do ls you’ll see a directory 2021-remote-computing-binder/. Let’s cd into it - cd 2021-re&lt;TAB&gt; if you hit the TAB key where it says &lt;TAB&gt;, you’ll get command-line completion to work. If you type ls -F you should see some familiar sights (at least if you attended workshops 1 and 2) - 2cities/ binder/ data/ README.md SouthParkData/ – yep, these are the files we worked with on those two days! 3.5.3 Revisiting file and path manipulation If you cd data/ and do ls you’ll see the following files: MiSeq Slide1.jpg hello.sh nano1.png README.md gvng.jpg nano2.png and with ls -a we will see the following: . MiSeq Slide1.jpg hello.sh nano1.png .. README.md gvng.jpg .hidden nano2.png Now, if you navigate into the tmp1 directory located in the .hidden directory, cd .hidden/tmp1 you will be in a different absolute directory than you were on in the binder - now it’ll be something like /home/ctbrown/2021-remote-computing-binder/data/.hidden/tmp1, rather than /home/jovyan/data/.hidden/tmp1. That’s because we’re on a different system, with a different user account than before, and (unlike with the binder) we are going to be doing more things than just exploring the contents of the binder, so we’ve put things in the folder underneath 2021-remote-computing/ to contain data for today and workshop 4. This is an example of home directory organization and project management, which we’ll be talking about in workshop 6 (project organization) - how to organize your account so that you can figure out what the files in it probably mean. At this point, you could do the rest of workshop 1’s lesson, but rather than do that, let’s just note that all of the relative path navigation you did will continue to work, even though you’re on a different computer in a different account than you were using for workshops 1 and 2. For example, you can copy files between directories using the same relative path as before, cp thisinnotit.txt ../tmp2 and we navigate to the tmp2 directory and list the files that are in it we will see the thisinnotit.txt file has been copied to the tmp2 directory. cd ../tmp2 ls -l – but the difference is that this directory is now under /home/ACCOUNT/2021-remote-computing-binder/data/ rather than /home/jovyan/data/. Try running pwd and you’ll see that: pwd 3.5.4 Revisiting file editing Now go back to the 2021-remote-computing binder directory – cd ~/2021-re&lt;TAB&gt; Here, the ~/ refers to the absolute path to your home directory, whatever your username is - it’s different for everyone in the class! - and then the 2021-remote-computing-binder/ is a directory underneath it. We can use the file command as in workshop 2 to look at the file type of 2cities/book.txt.gz – file 2cities/book.txt.gz – and then uncompress it, gunzip 2cities/book.txt.gz which will produce the uncompressed file 2cities/book.txt from the compressed file 2cities/book.txt.gz. If we run head on the .txt file, we’ll see the first 10 lines of the file: head 2cities/book.txt Conveniently, all three editors that we showed you in workshop 2 are available here - let’s use nano (or an editor of your choice) to edit the book.txt file. If you’re using nano, run nano 2cities/book.txt and use the arrow key to go down 9 lines to a blank line, and type kilroy was here! or something else silly and identifiable. Now save, using CTRL-X, then ‘y’, then ENTER. Now, if you run head 2cities/book.txt you should see that your edits are there. A difference from what we did in workshops 1 and 2 is that these changes are now persistent. Unlike binder, the files on farm don’t go away when you log out! 3.6 Copying files to and from your local computer. So, we’ve just edited files on the ‘farm’ computer, which is a remote computer system (located on the UC Davis campus). Suppose that we want to get a copy of that file locally. How do we do that? The method varies depending on which ssh client you’re using. 3.6.1 Mac OS X: Copying files using ssh. If you’re on Mac OS X, log out of farm by typing logout and now you will be still in the Terminal program, but your shell prompt will be running on your local computer instead of farm. Note: it’s important that you’re no longer at the farm prompt! You should not see ‘farm’ in the command-line prompt! Now run the following command, replacing ‘-XX’ with your datalab account number: scp datalab-XX@farm.cse.ucdavis.edu:2021-remote-computing-binder/2cities/book.txt /tmp and you should see output that looks something like this: book.txt 100% 788KB 2.6MB/s 00:00 The scp command stands for “secure copy” and it mimics the syntax of the cp command: scp &lt;from&gt; &lt;to&gt;, where either &lt;from&gt; or &lt;to&gt; can be a remote location of the form login@computer:path/to/location. Now open your /tmp folder - you can do that with open /tmp - and you should see ‘book.txt’ there! 3.6.2 Windows: Copying files using MobaXterm. This is actually pretty easy :). Go to the file pane in your MobaXterm window, and select 2021-remote-computing-binder. Then select the 2cities folder. Then select ‘book.txt’, and click the ‘download’ button. (See screenshot below.) It will ask you where to put it; just put it somewhere you can find it, like your Desktop. 3.6.3 View and change the file you just downloaded Go ahead and open the file you just downloaded on your local system. You should see the changes you made with the nano editor on the remote system. Congratulations!! Now, edit it using whatever editor you like and change something recognizable. Be sure to save it! 3.6.4 Copy the file back to farm. On Windows with MobaXterm, you can use the “upload” button (next to the download button :) to upload book.txt from your Desktop back to farm. On Mac OS X, you need to run the command: scp /tmp/book.txt datalab-XX@farm.cse.ucdavis.edu:2021-remote-computing-binder/2cities/ CHALLENGE: Now verify that your book.txt file on farm contains the changes you made on your local computer, by: if you’re on Mac OS X, logging into farm changing to the 2021-remote-computing-binder/2cities/ directory using head, less, or an editor to look at the book.txt file. 3.6.5 Digression: why do you need to log into/log out of farm on Mac OS X? You may have noticed that, on Mac OS X, we’re logging out of farm to run commands on the local machine. That’s because scp is a shell command that’s running on your local computer. That brings up two questions. First, why aren’t we running it on farm? And second, is there any way that we can avoid logging out, the way the Windows folk can avoid logging out? The answer to the first question is that 3.7 Some commands are available! Others are not. You may remember looking at the South Park CSV data set in lesson 2 - cd ~/2021-remote-computing-binder/SouthParkData/ gunzip All-seasons.csv.gz head All-seasons.csv and those commands are all standard UNIX commands. You can also use cut, grep, sort, and uniq just fine - for example, let’s calculate how many times a character in South Park (in column 3) has “computer” in its name – cut -d, -f3 All-seasons.csv | grep Computer | sort | uniq -c So those commands all work. But csvtk doesn’t – this command fails, csvtk cut -f Character All-seasons.csv | grep Computer | sort | uniq -c because csvtk isn’t installed. And that’s what we’ll be showing you how to do in workshop 5 - install software like csvtk using conda. 3.8 Summing up file transfer - a challenge! Let’s all do the following: Download the file All-seasons.csv from the directory 2021-remote-computing-binder/SouthParkData/ on farm to your local computer. Open it in a spreadsheet program and edit the first line. Export it to a CSV file with the name All-seasons-changed.csv Upload the file back to farm, to the directory 2021-remote-computing-binder/SouthParkData/ Log into farm and confirm it’s there and that the changes are present, using head All-seasons-changed.csv. 3.9 Summing things up Today, you learned how to log into remote systems, execute commands, and transfer files to and from your local computer. In our next workshop we will talk more about using shared systems to do work.

We will discuss input and output formats, where files are usually read from and written to, and how to use the ssh software to copy files to and from remote computers. In workshop 4, we will do more with running remote commands, getting files onto your remote system, file permissions, and actually working effectively on remote systems. We will also talk a bit about processes and other aspects of multiuser systems. 4.1 Using SSH private/public key pairs Today we’re going to start by using a different way to log in - ssh key pairs. Key pairs are a different way to provide access, and they rely on some mathematical magic called asymmetric cryptography or public-key cryptography (see wikipedia). (The details are far beyond the scope of this lesson, but it’s a fascinating read!) There are two parts to key pairs - the private part, which you keep private; and the public part, which you can post publicly. Anyone with the public key can challenge you to verify that you have the private key, and only the person with the private key can verify, so it’s a way to “prove” your identity and access. (The same idea can be used to sign e-mails!) Key pairs solve some of the problems with passwords. In brief, they are (much!) harder to guess than passwords. key pairs enable programs to do things without you having to type in your password. the private part of a key pair is NEVER shared, unlike with passwords where you have to type the password in. but the public part of pair can be shared widely. Because of these features, some systems demand that you use them. Farm is (usually) one of them; we have a special exception for the datalab-XX accounts, because key pairs are a confusing concept to teach right off the bat. 4.2 Mac OS X and Linux: Using ssh private keys to log in Your private key for your datalab-XX account is kept in .ssh/id_rsa. We need to copy it locally to make use of it. Run the following command in your Terminal window: cd ~/ scp datalab-XX@farm.cse.ucdavis.edu:.ssh/id_rsa datalab.pem and then chmod og-rwx datalab.pem (we’ll explain the second command below!) datalab.pem is your private key pair! Now, to log into farm using the key pair, run ssh -i datalab.pem datalab-XX@farm.cse.ucdavis.edu and voila, you are in! (VICTORY!) You’ll need to keep track of your datalab.pem file. I recommend keeping it in your home directory for now, which is where we downloaded it. 4.3 Windows/MobaXterm: Using ssh private keys to log in For MobaXterm, connect as you did in workshop 3 and download .ssh/id_rsa to some location on your computer, named datalab.pem. Now, create a new session and go to “Advanced SSH options” and select it the private key pair (see screenshot). Now connect. Voila! No password needed! VICTORY!! Note that if you change the location of your private key file, you’ll need to go find it again :). 4.4 Some tips on your private key NEVER SHARE YOUR PRIVATE KEY. We’ll talk more about private key management in the future, but the basic idea is that you should create a new private key for each computer you are using, and only share the public key from that computer. 4.5 Working on farm So farm is a shared computer with persistent storage (which is typical of a remote workstation or campus compute cluster (HPC). This means a few different things! Let’s start by logging back into farm. (You got this!) 4.5.1 First, download some files: Let’s make sure you have the right set of files from the last workshop – this will take the set of files here and make them appear in your farm account: cd ~/ git clone https://github.com/ngs-docs/2021-remote-computing-binder/ (If you’ve already done this, you can run this again and it will just fail, and that’s fine.) 4.5.2 Configuring your account on login One thing you can do is configure your account on login the way you want. This typically involves configuring your login shell. Edit the file ~/.bashrc, e.g. with nano: nano ~/.bashrc and type echo Hello and welcome to farm at the top of the file. If using nano, save with CTRL-X, say “yes” to save, hit ENTER. Now log out and log back in. You should now see ‘Hello and welcome to farm’ every time you log in! (You can easily delete it too, if you find it annoying :) The commands in .bashrc are run every time you run bash, which is the default login shell on farm. (There are other command-line shells, too, and they would be configured using different files.) There’s also a file called .profile that is run for every login and we may touch on that difference later - here’s a help article on it if you’re interested. Perhaps more usefully than ‘echo’, you can add commands like alias lf=&#39;ls -FC&#39; in your .bashrc if you want to configure your account that way; we’ll cover more configuration commands in workshop 6 and beyond. To see the changes without having to log out and log back in, run source ~/.bashrc and now lf will automatically run ls with your favorite options. For another example, here you could make rm ask you for confirmation when deleting files: alias rm=&#39;rm -i&#39; CHALLENGE QUESTION: Create an alias of hellow that prints out hello, world and add it to your .bashrc; verify that it works on login! 4.6 Using multiple terminals You don’t have to be logged in just once. On Mac OS X, you can use Command-N to open a new Terminal window, and then ssh into farm from that window too. On Windows, you can open a new connection from MobaXterm simply by double clicking your current session under “User sessions.” What you’ll end up with are different command-line prompts on the same underlying system. They share: directory and file access (filesystem) access to run the same programs, potentially at the same time They do not have the same: current working directory (pwd) running programs, and stdin and stdout (e.g. ls in one will not go to the other) These are essentially different sessions on the same computer, much like you might have multiple folders or applications open on your Mac or Windows machine. You can log out of one independently of the other, as well. And you can have as many terminal connections as you want! You just have to figure out how to manage them :). CHALLENGE: Open two terminals logged into farm simultaneously - let’s call them A and B. In A, create a file named ~/hello.txt, and add some text to it. (You can use an editor like nano, or you can use echo with a redirect, for example. If you use an editor, remember to save and exit!) In B, view the contents of ~/hello.txt. (You can use cat or less or an editor to do so.) A tricky thing here is that B does not necessarily have a way to know that you’re editing a file in A. So you have to be sure to save what you’re doing in one window, before trying to work with it in the other. We’ll cover more of how to work in multiple shell sessions in workshop 7 and later. 4.6.1 Who am I and where am I running!? If you start using remote computers frequently, you may end up logging into several different computers and have several different sessions open at the same time. This can get …confusing! (We’ll show you a particularly neat way to confuse yourself in workshop 7!) There are several ways to help track where you are and what you’re doing. One is via the command prompt. You’ll notice that on farm, the command prompt contains three pieces of information by default: your username, the machine name (‘farm’), and your current working directory! This is precisely so that you can look at a terminal window and have some idea of where you’re running. You might also find the following commands useful: This command will give you your current username: whoami and this command will give you the name of the machine you’re logged into: hostname These can be useful when you get confused about where you are and who you’re logged in as :) 4.6.2 Looking at what’s running You can use the ps command to see what your account, and other accounts, are running: ps -u datalab-09 This lists all of the different programs being run by that user, across all their shell sessions. The key column here is the last one, which tells you what program is running under that process. You can also get a sort of “leaderboard” for what’s going on on the shared computer by running top (use ‘q’ to exit). This gives a lot of information about running processes, sorted by who is using the most CPU time. If the system is really slow, it may be because one or more people are running a lot of things, and top will help you figure out if that’s the problem. (Another problem could be if a lot of people are downloading things simultaneously, like we did in workshop 3; and yet another problem that is much harder to diagnose could be that one or more people are writing a lot to the disk.) This is one of the consequences of having a shared system. You have access to extra compute, disk, and software that’s managed by professionals (yay!), but you also have to deal with other users (boo!) who may be competing with you for resources. We’ll talk more about this when we come to workshop 10, where we talk about bigger analyses and the SLURM system for making use of compute clusters by reserving or scheduling compute. If performance problems persist for more than a few minutes, it can be a good idea to e-mail the systems administrators, so that they are alerted to the problem. How to do so is individual on each computer system. On that note – 4.6.3 E-mailing the systems administrators When sending an e-mail to support about problems you’re having with a system, it’s really helpful if you include: your username and the system you’re working on the program or command you’re trying to use, together with as much information about it as possible (version, command line, etc.) what you’re trying to do and what’s going wrong (“I’m trying to log in from my laptop to farm on the account datalab-06, and it’s saying ‘connection closed’.”) a screenshot or copy/paste of the confusing behavior a thank you This information is all useful because they deal with dozens of users a day, and may be managing many systems, and may not be directly familiar with the software you’re using. So the more information you can provide the better! 4.7 File systems, directories, and shared systems One of the other consequences of working on a shared system is that you’re often sharing file systems with other people. That means you need to make sure they don’t have access to things they shouldn’t have access to. 4.7.1 Read and write permissions into other directories Try running this: ls ~datalab-09/ what do you see? That’s right, that’s my account, and my files. Now run it again: ls ~datalab-09/ By default, home directories on many systems are readable by everyone. However, they’re never writable unless you enable that intentionally for a directory. To see that, try creating a file in my home directory: echo hi &gt; ~datalab-09/test.txt and you will see Permission denied. 4.7.2 Listing directory and file permissions Let’s look at your home directory: ls -lad ~/ you should see something like: drwx------ 3 datalab-08 datalab-08 3 Aug 5 18:32 /home/datalab-08 and compare that to what you get if you look at my home directory: ls -lad ~datalab-09/ where you will see: drwxr-xr-x 8 datalab-09 datalab-09 10 Aug 11 17:59 /home/datalab-09 what does this all mean? In order, you have: ‘d’ means directory the first ‘rwx’ means ‘readable, writable, executable by owner’ the second ‘r-x’ means ‘readable, not writable, executable by group’ the third ‘r-x’ means ‘readable, not writable, executable by others’ the first ‘datalab-09’ is the owner of the directory the second ’datalab In the context of directories, the “x” means “can change into it.” If a directory is not +x for a particular user, that means they cannot change into it or into any directory underneath it. (We’ll talk more about what “executable” means in workshop 7, when we talk about scripting.) If you go back and look at your own home directory, you can see that by default (the way these accounts were set up), only you have drwx------ 3 datalab-08 datalab-08 3 Aug 5 18:32 /home/datalab-08 Now let’s modify it so that other members of group datalab-08 can access it – chmod g+rx ~/ ls -lad ~/ and you should see: drwxr-x--- 3 datalab-08 datalab-08 3 Aug 5 18:32 /home/datalab-08 Likewise, you could make it group writable with g+w, and you could make it world readable with o+rx - for example, ~ctbrown is world readable. You can set user, group, and ‘other’ permissions all at once with ‘a’ - so, for example, chmod a+rx ~/ would make your home directory readable/executable by the user, the group, and everyone else. One particularly useful thing you can do is make files read only for yourself! This prevents you from changing or deleting them by accident. For example, echo do not change me &gt; important-file.txt chmod a-w important-file.txt echo new information &gt; important-file.txt and you should see ‘permission denied.’ 4.7.3 Files have the same permission options So far we’ve been talking about directories, but files have the same permission settings. Try running ls -la ~/ and you’ll see the same kind of output for files. Here you can set +r or -r for read, +w or -w for write, etc. 4.7.4 How do groups work? You might be puzzled to note that your files belong to a group with the same name as your username. What’s up with that? On many systems (farm included) users are set up with a default group that only they belong to. Then users are added to additional groups as needed. This gives them the option of using groups for sharing files via group permissions, but decreases the likelihood that files get shared by accident. For this reason, all of the datalab-XX users belong to multiple groups: one group that is uniquely yours, and one group that is shared by all of the datalab-XX users. You can see what groups you (and other users) are members of like so: groups datalab-09 where you will see that I am a member of two groups, datalab-09 and datalab. If you are a member of a group, you can use the chgrp command to change the owning group of a file to that group: echo test &gt; test-file.txt chgrp datalab test-file.txt ls -lad test-file.txt CHALLENGE: What commands would you run to change the permissions on test-file.txt so that all the datalab-XX users have read and execute (but not write!) access to it? Note that all datalab-XX users belong to the datalab group. (You may not want to run these commands, but it won’t hurt if you do. Plus you can always change them back.) 4.7.5 How can you use this? I rarely use group permissions in my home directory, because I usually default to having my files be a+r But sometimes on farm there are large files that people in my research group want to share with each other but not with others, and you can use group permissions to manage access to things like that. Good practice (or at least practice that I recommend) is to do the following: put research-private files under directories that are g+rx and o-rwx. if you have a directory where you want people to be able to add new files but not change old ones, you can make the directory itself g+rwx but keep the files g+r and g-w (which is usually the default). That having been said, when setting something like this up for the first time, it’s worth writing down what you want the access permissions to be, then setting them up with chmod, and then checking with someone experienced (like the systems administrators) that you’ve got the right permissions for the policies you want to enforce. Note also that UNIX file permissions are kind of a blunt instrument, so I recommend keeping it as simple as possible. Generally you want to be using a separate system for tracking raw data and making sure that it’s backed up, etc. - there are various archival systems that we can recommend, depending on your file sizes and your research needs. 4.7.6 Things that regular users cannot do There are basically no exceptions to the permissions rules above for regular users. Linux has (by default) only two “tiers” of users - a regular user, and a “superuser”, usually referred to as “root”. Only root can do things like change the ownership of files, access files with restrictive permissions, etc. One situation where this can be important is when someone leaves a research group and you need access to their files but they no longer have access to the system themselves because their account is disabled. In this case, you might have to have a supervisor or the researcher themselves e-mail the farm systems administrators to fix the access problem, because they are the only people besides the owner of the file(s) who can change the permissions. It’s also a good reminder that on shared systems, other people will have access to your files - that’s completely legal and correct (because they’re the people running the system!) But this is why you need to be careful about what systems you use to store sensitive information, and why words like “HIPAA compliant” become important - it ensures that certain security and access policies are in place to protect sensitive data. 4.8 Disk space, file size, and temporary files You can see how much free disk space you have in the current directory with this command: df -h . You can see how much disk space a directory is using with du: du -sh ~/ I highly recommend using /tmp for small temporary files. For bigger files that you might want to persist but only need on one particular system, there is often a location called /scratch where you can make a directory for yourself and store things. We’ll talk more about that in workshop 10. Finally, the command free will show you how much system memory is available and being used. This command: cat /proc/cpuinfo will give you far too much information about what processors are available. Again, we’ll talk more about this in workshop 10 :). 4.9 Summing things up In this workshop, we talked a fair bit about working on shared systems, setting permissions on files, transferring files around, and otherwise being effective with using remote computers to do things. In workshop 5, we’ll show you how to customize your software environment so you can do the specific work you want to do. We’ll use CSV files, R, and some bioinformatics tools as examples.

We will give examples of installing Python and R software, and managing conda environments on remote systems. This lesson was adopted from a lesson co-authored by Shannon Joslin for GGG 298 at UC Davis. There is also a really nice binder-based tutorial on the NIH CFDE training Web site! Learning objectives: learn the basics of software installation, software dependencies, and isolation environments learn about conda and how to use it learn about conda-forge and bioconda and how to install software from them learn to use conda to manage R and Python installations Other references: ANGUS 2019 lesson Why you need Python Environments and How to Manage Them with Conda 5.1 Why is software installation hard? It’s a confusing ecosystem of operating systems (Mac OS X, many versions of Linux, Windows) Many software has many dependencies (e.g. just consider base language – C++, Java, Python, R, and their different versions) Caption: Software has a lot of dependencies This leads to confusing situations where different versions of underlying software are need to run two different programs – what if you wanted to run Macs14 and sourmash both, but one wanted ‘python’ to mean python2 and the other wanted ‘python’ to mean python3? Caption: sometimes different software packages can’t coexist Decoupling user-focused software from underlying operating systems is a Big Deal - imagine, otherwise you’d have to rebuild software for every OS! (This is kind of what conda does for you, actually - it’s just centralized!) Also, lot of software installation currently requires (or at least is much easier with) sysadmin privileges, which is inherently dangerous. Why do you need isolated software install environments? Some specific reasons: your work relies on a bunch of specific versions (perhaps old versions?) working with a collaborator who really likes a particular feature! experiment with new packages without messing up current workflow (reproducibility!) publication (“here’s what I used for software”, repeatability!) sometimes workflows rely on incompatible software packages! see my twitter question Conda tries to solve all of these problems, and (in my experience) largely succeeds. That’s what we’ll explore today. Conda is a solution that seems to work pretty well, and can be used by any user. Downsides are that it can get big to have everyone install their own software system, but it’s not that big… (The farm admins like it, too!) Caption: conda environments and packages Note that conda emerged from the Python world but is now much broader and works for many more software packages, including R! 5.2 Getting started with conda 5.2.1 Installing conda We installed conda in your account already for you. In case you want to install it on another computer, or in another account, the miniconda installation instructions are pretty good! Note that we also added the following software sources to your installation, conda config --add channels defaults conda config --add channels bioconda conda config --add channels conda-forge and we’ll talk about this later. But if you install miniconda on your own, you’ll need to run these commands in your new installation to set up the software sources correctly. 5.2.2 Log into farm As per the instructions in workshop 3 and workshop 4, log into farm.cse.ucdavis.edu using your datalab-XX account. When you log in, your prompt should look like this: (base) datalab-09@farm:~$ If it doesn’t, please alert a TA and we will help you out! The ‘base’ part of the prompt is new and it indicates that conda has been activated in your account and that you are in the base environment. Read on! 5.2.3 Creating your first environment &amp; installing csvtk! 5.2.3.1 What is a conda environment? A conda environment is a specific collection of packages/tools that you have installed. For example, you may have one environment with Python 2.7 and its dependencies, and another environment with Python 3.4, both for legacy testing. And then you might have a Python 3.9 environment for the latest version of Python. Environments are isolated from each other: if you change one environment, your other environments are not affected. You can easily activate new environments, which is how you switch between them. 5.2.4 Installation! Let’s install some software! We’ll start with csvtk, which we introduced in workshop 2, working with text files. Here’s the command to create a new conda environment, named ‘csv’, with csvtk installed. conda create --name csv -y csvtk Here, we are installing the csvtk package into an environment named csv. The -y indicates that we don’t want conda to ask us for confirmation - it should just go ahead and create the environment. Now, activate the new environment: conda activate csv Your prompt should change to have (csv) at the beginning. Let’s run csvtk on some real data now! We’ll use the files from workshop 2 (see these instructions for getting them) – make sure this works: cd ~/2021-remote-computing-binder/SouthParkData gunzip All-seasons.csv.gz ls -l All-seasons.csv (FYI, you may get an error in the gunzip command if you’ve already run that - it’s fine!) You should now be able to run: csvtk cut -f Character All-seasons.csv | grep Computer | sort | uniq -c and you should see: 13 Computer 3 Computer Voice 5.2.5 csvtk in a bit more detail Let’s explore csvtk a bit - what’s going on here? csvtk is a cross-platform library for working with CSV and TSV files. It’s written and maintained by Wei Shen, and it’s free and open source. It’s relatively new - I found out about it only a year or two ago - and while it doesn’t do anything I couldn’t do with other commands, it packages a bunch of really nice functionality together into one tool. For example, I can find the headers in a csv file like so, csvtk headers All-seasons.csv and I can then cut out one particular column and summarize things – e.g. csvtk cut -f Character All-seasons.csv | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail (which tells me that Cartman is by far the most quoted character in this file). What I’m doing here is using piping and filtering (from workshop 2) to: take the contents of the Character column, produced by csvtk sorting the contents (sort) counting the number of distinct elements (uniq -c) sorting the counts from least to most by number (sort -n) and then showing only the last 10 (tail) (It looks complicated, but as you start using these commands more and more, it will become second nature!) CHALLENGE: How would I find the least quoted characters in this file? The key thing about csvtk for this lesson is that it’s new software, and it’s mostly useful for data scientists, so it’s not “built into” UNIX operating systems yet (and may never be). So when you try running it in the base environment, conda activate base csvtk you’ll get “command not found” because it’s not installed. But conda lets us install it from bioconda, a community repository of software! And then we can use it! Yay! If you go back to your csv environment, you’ll see that you can run it again: conda activate csv csvtk 5.2.6 Where is the software coming from!? When we run conda create to install csvtk, where is conda looking for and finding the software? The short answer is “the Internet”, and more specifically, pre-prepared conda software repositories, or “channels”. Bioconda is one such channel, as is conda-forge. We’ll talk more about channels below. 5.2.7 Digression: there are many ways to install software! If you’re at all familiar with UNIX, you might be saying “wait! but I already use homebrew! or apt! or yum! or containers! or …!” Or you may point your sysadmins at this tutorial and they’ll say “well you should just use the modules system on your HPC.” Yes, there are many ways to install and use software! Why conda? We like conda, because it’s straightforward, flexible, cross-platform, supports version pinning, and does not require systems administrator access. In the past 12 years of teaching bioinformatics and data science, conda has come closest to being the thing that works for everyone, on every platform. As they say, “your mileage may vary” (YMMV). But we like conda :). 5.3 Installing more software in your current environment Once you’re in an environment, you can install new software with conda install -y &lt;software_name&gt; like so: conda install -y fastqc and that should work too! You’ll be able to run the fastqc command now. Here, FastQC is a completely separate application that we use in bioinformatics for looking at FASTQ files. We talk about that more in some other workshops we run, but: the main point is that it’s just some more “non-standard” software that you can install! Generally you want to avoid installing too many packages in one environment, as it starts to get slow to figure out whether or not something can be installed. We’ll talk more about this below. You can list software with conda list: conda list which is less useful than you might think, given how many packages we’ve installed… in the future you will be able to list only the user-requested packages and not the dependencies needed for them, but for now, there’s no good way to do that. (Why are there so many? Because most software is built on top of lots of other software… and so you need to install all of that other software, too!) 5.3.1 Finding and specifying versions To see what version of a particular piece of software you have installed, run: conda list csvtk and look at the second column. (Note that conda list doesn’t need an exact match, so e.g. you can find all packages with ‘csv’ in the name by doing conda list csv). As of Aug 2021, conda installs csvtk version 0.23.0. You can force conda to install exactly this version in the future like so, conda install csvtk==0.23.0 Unfortunately there’s no good way to know if a new version of a software package is “significant” or not, unless they use semantic versioning… Generally if there’s a big number update (1.0 -&gt; 2.0) the software will work quite differently, but there’s no guarantee on that. For example, our software sourmash 1.0 was very different from 2.0, while sourmash 3.0 was virtually identical to 2.0 in usage (but not in implementation). The next version, sourmash 4.0, broke things. (The lesson is, don’t trust software projects to be consistent in their versioning!) CHALLENGE: Use the conda create command to create a new environment and install the latest version of sourmash in it. Then activate that environment and verify that you can run ‘sourmash’. Make sure to switch back to your csv environment when you’re all done: conda activate csv 5.3.2 Making and using environment files What if you want to specify collections of software that you use together? And/or send collaborators or colleagues the set of software they need, all in one nice file? conda has a nice human-readable format for that, called an ‘environment file’. These are supposed to be reasonably portable files that you can ship around to different computers and have them automatically install the right stuff. You can see the one for the binder for workshops 1 and 2 here, for example. (These are YAML files, which are in a format that’s structured for computers to read but not super difficult for humans to write. You’ll see these used occasionally in configuration files for bioinformatics software, too.) If you have a complicated environment that you want to save, you can make an environment file from your current environment like so: conda env export &gt; export.yml To look at the environment files we’ve just created, do: cat export.yml and you can create a new environment from this file like so: conda env create -n csv2 -f export.yml This would create a new environment called csv2 that has all the same things installed in it as csv does (because that’s where we ran conda env export!) 5.3.3 Updating, removing, etc software You can update software with conda update, and remove software with conda remove. Generally there’s not too much need for these commands tho, as we recommend just creating new environments with a pinned version, OR the latest version. Then, when you want to update your software, you create a new, clean environment. 5.3.4 Creating multiple environments As you can probably infer from the above, you can have multiple environments with different (potentially incompatible) things installed in each one. The default is base. Other environments will have their own set of packages. Environments do not include packages from other environments; you’ll need to install each package in every environment that needs it. You can list environments with conda env list: conda env list It will list all of the available environments as well as denote the environment you are currently in with an *. Switch environments with conda activate &lt;environment_name&gt;, and remove environments with conda env remove -n &lt;environment_name&gt;. Note that switching environments doesn’t switch your directory, it just switches the software you’re running.. Whoa… 5.3.5 Tech interlude: what is conda doing? What conda does when it switches environments is change the location where it searches for software – the PATH (and other environment variables) – so that the software packages are searched for in different places. Try changing environments and each time doing echo $PATH. You should see that the first element in the PATH changes each time you switch environments! (You can also use type &lt;program&gt; or which &lt;program&gt; to see where a program is located, and which program you are running when you type &lt;program&gt;. 5.3.6 Challenges with using one big environment We generally recommend using a task-specific environments for each task (e.g. one environment for your R work, and another for your bioinformatics work), because this can dramatically simplify installation and speed up new conda installs. This is because conda needs to make sure that any new package (and all of its dependencies) you would like to install doesn’t conflict with all the existing packages. 5.3.7 How Titus uses conda That having been said, my experience is that I rely on a core set of packages for my daily work, and so I usually have my “daily work” environment where I have a bunch of stuff installed, and then when I’m working on data analysis, I don’t want to constantly install new things or switch environments. So I usually have a default environment that I work in, and when I use non-standard software (stuff I use infrequently or for specific tasks) I create software-specific environments to work in. snakemake (which we’ll be talking about in workshop 9) helps with this by letting you use analysis-specific environments. 5.3.8 Finding packages within conda To search for all available versions of a particular package from the command line, do: conda search &lt;software&gt; 5.4 Using the ‘bioconda’ and ‘conda-forge’ channels Conda-forge and Bioconda are “software channels” for conda, that provide collections of conda-packaged software. In particular, conda-forge contains an awful lot of general community packages as well as many Python and R libraries, while bioconda is more focused on biology/bioinformatics tools specifically. You can install stuff directly from these channels by specifying the bioconda channel explicitly: conda install -c bioconda .... Or, you can add it to your “default” set of channels to search, as we did above: (You don’t need to run these, but you can:) conda config --add channels defaults conda config --add channels bioconda conda config --add channels conda-forge this sets up your .condarc file – take a look, cat ~/.condarc This will automatically make conda install search for packages in bioconda. Note: if you get the error PackagesNotFoundError: The following packages are not available from current channels: but you’re pretty sure the package exists, you probably need to configure your channels properly :) 5.4.1 Mac OS X and Linux, but not Windows Note conda itself works on Windows, OS X and Linux! But unfortunately many conda-forge and bioconda packages are only available for OS X and Linux, and not Windows :(. This is because they are built for Linux or a UNIX-like OS. 5.4.2 How to engage with conda-forge and bioconda Both conda-forge and bioconda are community-driven libraries of software. They rely upon people (like you!) to package software; this involves writing a recipe, like the sourmash recipe. Some tips and tricks for using conda-forge and bioconda: Both are community maintained, please be respectful and friendly - no one is working for you, and no one is making money doing this. Help advocate for your favorite software to be added, and/or do it yourself! (e.g. gtdbtk) - we can help! File bug reports, but be respectful and helpful. See a sterling example :). 5.5 Conda and data science: R and Python Conda emerged from the Python community initially, but it now has some pretty good support for R as well, through the conda-forge channel. Why use Conda for R and Python? What does it give you? A few things - with conda, you can manage multiple R and Python installations, each containing different (and incompatible!) versions of packages. where libraries are available via conda, you can install them without compiling them. This can be (much) faster than using the standard install.packages or pip install supported by R and Python. where libraries are not available via conda, you can still install them, and you don’t need to do anything special or tricky - just run the standard installation commands. 5.5.1 Conda and R conda-forge now has some pretty good support for R - see this environment file for RNAseq, for example. It installs both tidyverse packages and bioconductor packages! Let’s install R with RMarkdown support. First, let’s figure out what the right package name is. We could go to the conda-forge page and search for rmarkdown, but it turns out that google is often your best bet :). Google ‘install rmarkdown with conda’ and you’ll see that the first hit is r-rmarkdown. Let’s try it! Side note: we’re going to switch to using the mamba command, because it’s faster. More on that below. mamba create -n rmd -y r-rmarkdown This will go ahead and install R itself, as well as all of the packages needed to compile RMarkdown documents (like this Web site, in fact). Activate the environment: conda activate rmd Now, try type R to see where R is installed - under your own account. Yay! If you want, you can run R and then library(rmarkdown) to verify that it’s installed. I’ve found that the majority of R packages I use in bioinformatics are readily available via conda-forge, which is nice. Again, your mileage may vary… CHALLENGE: What would be the command to install the dplyr library for R in either the existing rmd environment, or in a new environment? (You can run it if you like, but it might take a few minutes.) 5.5.2 Conda and Python Python is heavily used in data science as well, and it is also well supported by conda. Conveniently, you can install different versions quite easily: mamba create -n py39 -y python==3.9 will install Python v3.9. Then conda activate py39 type python python -V will show you that Python is v3.9 in this environment. Conveniently, as with R, you have full installation privileges - so you could run the python package installer, pip, to install stuff. For example, run: pip install screed to install the screed library in your very own Python environment. (screed is another library my lab built for reading sequence data files; here we’re just using it as an example of something that you can install with conda :). 5.5.3 Supporting interactive packages (RStudio and JupyterLab) Many (most?) people now use R and Python packages via RStudio and JupyterLab, and it’s totally possible to use conda installs with that. Unfortunately, showing you how to run RStudio Server and JupyterLab on farm is a bit out of scope for this workshop series, but please drop us a note at datalab-training@ucdavis.edu if you’re interested. 5.6 Tricky things to think about with conda 5.6.1 It can take a long time to install lots of software This is because conda needs to make sure to resolve version incompatibilities before proceeding. Solution: use isolated environments to install single packages, instead. Another solution: use the mamba command, a drop-in replacement for conda. All of the commands above will work with mamba instead of conda, except only conda activate which must be done using conda. 5.6.2 Explicit package listing You can grab an explicit list of version pinned software that is OS specific like so - conda list --explicit &gt; package-files.txt conda create --name myenv --file spec-file.txt conda install --name myenv --file spec-file.txt this will guarantee identical environments. See the conda docs for more information. 5.7 Reference list of Conda Commands Conda commands action conda install &lt;package_name&gt; install a package conda list list installed packages conda search &lt;package_name&gt; search for a package––this can be the full or partial name of a package conda info list of information about the currently active environment conda list list out all the installed packages in the currently active environment conda remove &lt;package_name&gt; remove a conda package conda config --get channels list out the active channels and their priorities conda update update all the installed packages conda config --remove channels &lt;channel&gt; remove unwanted channel conda env list list the different environments you have set up conda activate &lt;new_environment_name&gt; activate the a new conda environment conda (this also works for activating our base environment conda info --envs list the locations of conda directories 5.8 More Reading on Conda Conda Documentation Drawing credit: Gergely Szerovay. Read original article here 5.9 Discussion items: What happens if something isn’t conda installable? You can install it as normal, and it will be usable as normal. However, it won’t be “managed” via conda (or snakemake) Disk, vs environment, vs login shell especially note that multiple terminals all look at the same disk 5.10 In summary Conda is one way you can install software on computers, including most especially HPC and cloud computers. Conda lets you create separate “environments” containing collections of software that are isolated from other collections. Conda supports a pretty normal data science set of tools, and also provides tools to support computational reproducibility via environment files and version pinning. Go conda!!

But many people (myself included) find ‘scp’ kind of annoying because you have to already know the path to the filename, and it’s kind of inconvenient for transferring multiple files around. For this, we’re going to make the MobaXterm folk use a shell window: OK, so what options are there when using ‘scp’? 6.2.1 recursive scp with -r First, you can copy entire directories with scp by using -r – from your laptop, try doing scp -r datalab-XX@farm.cse.ucdavis.edu:2021-remote-computing-binder/2cities 2cities this will transfer the entire directory to your local computer. 6.2.2 sftp You can use a command line within a command line with sftp. Briefly, sftp datalab-XX@farm.cse.ucdavis.edu will open up a “secure file transfer” shell, that has its own set of commands. Try typing: cd 2021-remote-computing-binder cd 2cities ls get README.md – I use this quite a bit when I want to be able to use ‘cd’ and ‘ls’ to find the right file to download. 6.2.3 zip -r to create collections of files Zip files work on pretty much all systems, and are handy ways to transport collections of files. To create a zip file: cd ~/2021-remote-computing-binder zip -r 2cities.zip 2cities The file ~/2021-remote-computing-binder/2cities.zip is now a file you could copy or transfer around, and it will unpack to the entire contents of the directory 2cities/. To view the contents of a zip file: unzip -v 2cities.zip and to unpack it: cd ~/ unzip 2cities.zip which will create a new directory ~/2cities/. 6.2.4 Working with .tar.gz files While I strongly recommend using zip files, you will inevitably run into .tar.gz files on UNIX. You can think of these as “collections of files that have been glommed into one file and then gzipped”, and here are the two commands you need to know: tar tzvf ~ctbrown/2cities.tar.gz will show you the contents of a .tar.gz file, and tar xzvf ~ctbrown/2cities.tar.gz will unpack it into your current directory. I don’t recommend creating .tar.gz files in general so I’m not going to show you how to create them :). tar stands for ‘tape archive’ and is notoriously confusing to use, so I’m not going to say any more about it. (Obligatory xkcd on using the tar command.) 6.2.5 Probably the most useful advice: use a transfer directory To me, it’s really annoying to find and remember directory paths and filenames when transferring files around, and I’ve been doing it for 30 years and am really practiced at it. So what I sometimes do is use a ‘transfer’ directory. On farm, mkdir ~/transfer cp ~/2021-remote-computing/2cities/README.md ~/transfer/ and now (on your laptop) you can just do things like scp datalab-XX@farm.cse.ucdavis.edu:transfer/README.md . and you don’t have to remember the full path. This is handy because you can use your current working directory and things like tab completion on the remote system to copy files into your transfer directory, and then remember only a short path to actually transferring files around. I use this when I’m working in complicated or annoying directory structures. 6.3 Retrieving remote files from Web sites Often you want to grab files from Web sites - CSV data sets, text files, or what have you. This involves finding the URL, and then using a program like wget or curl to get them. We’re going to use curl today, but wget does pretty much the same thing. Let’s find a URL for the Tale of Two Cities book that we’ve been using, over on Project Gutenberg. Go to this Web site in a browser: https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/98 and find the link that says “Plain text”. Right click on it, and “copy link”. Now go back to your terminal window where you’re logged into farm, and run cd ~/ curl -L -O https://www.gutenberg.org/files/98/98-0.txt and this will create a file 98-0.txt in your current directory. You can run head on this file: head 98-0.txt and see that it contains the right text. The trick is often to find the right URL to get the raw text link. For example, if you go to a GitHub link, like https://github.com/ngs-docs/2021-remote-computing-binder/blob/latest/2cities/README.md if you run curl on this you will get the formatted Web file, which isn’t really what you want. What you want for GitHub files is the ‘Raw’ link - try clicking on that. This is now the text file, and you can use curl on it – curl -L -O https://github.com/ngs-docs/2021-remote-computing-binder/blob/latest/2cities/README.md Note here that the -L tells curl to follow Web redirects, which can be important; and -O says save the file under the name at the end of the URL. You can omit -O and it will send the file to stdout: curl -L https://github.com/ngs-docs/2021-remote-computing-binder/blob/latest/2cities/README.md &gt; new-file.txt cat new-file.txt The really nice thing about this is that for big files, the file will transfer directly between the hosting site and the remote computer. This is really handy for large sequencing data files that are located at sequencing facility Websites - you don’t have to download 100 GB files to your laptop and then transfer them from there to farm, or into the cloud, for example! (This is a big reason why cloud computing is really interesting for the NIH.) Other than finding and copying the right URL, the other tricky thing that doesn’t generalize is permission-restricted files. Briefly, since you’re copying the URL from your browser (where you may be logged in) over to farm (where you may not be logged in), farm may not have access to download it. There is no one-size-fits-all solution to this, unfortunately. And, again, we’ll be covering retrieving files from github in other ways during workshop 8. CHALLENGE: Pick any book from https://www.gutenberg.org/ Find the URL for the plain text Copy the URL Use wget to download it to farm Look at it with head 6.4 Dealing with files: some recommendations Some short-hand rules I recommend for working with files on remote systems. download big files directly to remote computer system if possible, so that they don’t go via your home/work Internet connection or laptop (which is often more limited than the remote computer’s connection!); get used to transferring files to/from your laptop (see below); consider using a transfer/ directory for simplicity; for managing small files that you create on a remote system, use version control (workshop 8) you can also configure Dropbox on Linux systems, but it burdens the system and it’s also not a great idea to copy files that are probably private over to a shared system. I’ve also had some bad experiences with deleting my entire Dropbox by mistake… UNIX makes it a little too easy to operate on lots of files! 6.5 Farm vs cloud, binder, etc. One of the main differences that you’ll see over time is that there are “remote, shared” systems like farm, and “remove, private” systems like binder and Amazon/Google cloud computers. The cloud computers often guarantee you resources and some level of privacy along with superuser privileges, but also charge you for it (and it’s often inefficient use of compute!) By contrast, “remote, shared” systems like HPCs and shared workstations can provide larger resources at the cost of sometimes having to worry about what other users are doing. The “ride share” vs “personal car” analogy is fairly apt here, actually :). 6.6 Thinking about data science projects! Figure 1 from Stoudt et al., 2021 For further discussion and details, I highly recommend Principles for data analysis workflows, Stoudt et al., 2021, which is the best exploration of real data science practice I’ve yet seen. (Conflict alert: I was a reviewer :) 6.7 a rough bioinformatics workflow a bioinformatics workflow 6.8 Sending and Receiving Data Here at UC Davis most researchers sequence at the UC Davis DNA Technologies Core. You can find their sample submission form here. When they’ve sequenced your samples they will hold your sequencing data on either SLIMS lab information management system for three months after the sequencing run finishes or bioshare for an undetermined amount of time. Do yourself a favor and download &amp; back your new sequencing data up to a hard disk IMMEDIATELY. 6.8.1 Downloading data To download your data from slims onto a cluster (by using slurm) follow these directions. Luckily for this class we don’t have data to download from the farm, so we’ll be grabbing some from OSF, an open science framework that can host small amounts of data (5Gb limit). Let’s setup a directory to work from and download some data: mkdir -p ~/298class8 cd ~/298class8 curl -L https://osf.io/srdhb/download -o mini_Alca-torda.tar.gz tar -xvf mini_Alca-torda.tar.gz cd mini_A-torda ls -alh And we should see a list of Alca torda chromosomes. We got some data! However, the data could have been changed or corrupted in the process of downloading it from the Internet. (This CAN happen, and WILL happen if you do this for long enough!) We can address this problem by using the md5sum command. md5sum, in short, is a command that spits out a string of characters to represent a file’s fingerprint. If a file with the same name has characters that are different the md5sum will show the difference, so we don’t have to find the difference. This is exceptionally valuable when we have files that contain billions of characters. Let’s see what an md5sum looks like: md5sum mini-chr1.fna.gz you should see something exactly like: d34e2c570ef79195dfb56b8c258490f8 mini-chr1.fna.gz Here you can see a string of characters that represent the mini-chr1.fna.gz md5sum. The first string of characters is the file’s “fingerprint”. The second is the name of the file–this is useful when we md5sum multiple files. If you change even a single byte of the file, the md5sum fingerprint will change completely. So, We can check to make sure the data downloaded successfully by seeing if the string of characters generated by md5sum matches the ones in the @mini_A-torda.md5 file. First, take a look at the file: less \\@mini_A-torda.md5 (press Q to exit) We can check a list of md5sum’s conatined in a file with the -c flag. The command will automatically look for files contained in the list and check the md5sum against the ones printed in the file. md5sum -c \\@mini_A-torda.md5 But if we navigate into the data/ directory we can see there is a mini-chr1.fna.gz file there too. Are they the same? CHALLENGE: Determine if the two mini-chr1.fna.gz scripts are the same. Anytime you download data you should check to make sure it has downloaded successfully. This includes raw sequence data from a sequencing center, data from collaborators host on a shared space, sequence files from NCBI, transfering data between devices, downloading data from clusters and so on and so forth. (Most sequencing centers will automatically provide md5sum’s with your data. If they do not, email to request them!) We can also make a list of md5sum’s for a group of files: cd ~/298class8/mini_A-torda md5sum mini-chr[1-9]*.fna.gz &gt;&gt; autosomes.md5 Here, we’ve redirected the output of the md5sum command to the autosomes.md5 file. We can then host/send our data with the md5 file for others to ensure the recipients know they’ve received the same data. 6.9 Storing data 6.9.1 What do I back up? raw data – YES – you only get them once! results files – YES – they are so useful intermediate files – maybe – they can be used in many different ways 6.9.2 How big should I expect the files to be? Raw data will probably be the biggest Results files depends on what you are doing Metadata are usually pretty small Intermediate files are usually smaller than your raw data files but there will be a lot of them Always, always back up raw data. Once the sequencing center deletes the data, it is gone forever! As such, make sure you’ve have your data backed up. As soon as you download onto the cluster back it up to another device (or two!). After you’ve finished your project you’ll probably have some pretty valuable results files. Back these up! It is likely that these files won’t be nearly as large as our original files and they can often be put on osf.io. Examples: file type size # of files Total Space Raw Genome Assembly sequencing files 44Gb 2 88Gb Intermediate files 12Gb 2 24Gb Assembled Genome ~550Mb 1 55Mb Raw RAD seq data 92Gb 2 184Gb Intermediate files from RADseq ~25Mb 20,925 741Gb Results of PopGen expt 9.3Mb 2 ~20Mb Data files will come in a variety of sizes. In general, the largest single files will be the raw data files, you receive from the sequencing center. Individual files in each subsequent step will be smaller (but there might be more of them!) because each step throws out or compresses data. However, new files are generated at most steps in bioinformatics projects. Because of this, the sheer number of intermediate files can take up a lot of space! 6.9.3 How often should I backup my data? Scripts: This varies person to person. I suggest posting your scripts to GitHub and to push to GitHub at least everyday you modify your scripts. (This is what we’ll teach next week!) GitHub will give you free private repositories as an academic, so you don’t need to make things public. Raw Data: Luckily, you’ll only need to backup your raw data once. Or maybe twice. Just don’t delete it! Results: Again, these only need to be backed up once. However, if you reanalyze your data make sure you save the new results. Or at least the workflow you used to get there. 6.9.4 Where do I back up my data? There are a number of places you can backup to, for better or for worse. Small amounts of data (&lt; 100 MB) that you would like version controlled, such as code, can be backed up to GitHub. Note that GitHub is not archival and cannot be used as the permanent post-publication place for your scripts, but there are solutions for that (search “github zenodo”). Small amounts of data (100 Mb - 5Gb) can be stored on a project by project basis at the Open Science Framework. Each project is allocated 5Gb of space and there is no limit on number of projects. OSF also supports private and collaborative projects, and can be referred to in publications, so you can use it as your “raw results” location too. Large amounts of data (&gt; 5Gb) The most tangible solution to a bioinformatics problem is to back data up to a (or multiple) hard drives! Data can be stored via your Google Drive account. To store data using storage space that UC Davis has allocated to you, see this Meet &amp; Analyze Data tutorial. 6.10 Where do I work with large amounts of data? 6.10.1 High Performance Computing Clusters aka clusters (or HPCs). UC Davis has a number of clusters available to students, depending on your department or where your lab has purchased resources: farm crick barbera Pros: - maintained on campus - help desk for troubleshooting Cons: - maintained on campus - requires an initial buy in to get a significant amount of space &amp; compute 6.10.2 Amazon Web Service These are cloud computing services provided by Amazon (what don’t they provide!?) Pros: - Only pay for what you use - Can have temporary access to supercomputers which could end up costing less than consistent access on a cluster - great for short-term massive compute needs, if you have the $$ Cons: - no long term storage…unless you want to pay for that too - must build everything yourself - no help desk - have to pay for downloading (“egress charges”) All platforms have pluses and minuses. The one that will work best for you depends on your lab. I prefer the farm, for ease of use &amp; consistency, if your lab will support you. 6.11 Setting up your project QUESTION Imagine you are at the end of a bioinformatics project, about to write up the manuscript. Looking back over carrying out your experiment(s), what were the top 3-5 most useful things to getting to the point of writing up? 6.11.1 Things to think about multiple projects inputs and outputs directory structure testing analyses In bioinformatics, organization is everything. It allows us to be efficient in setting up experiments, maintain consistency between experiments and, in some cases, repeat a previous analysis. Here we can see how organization allows for a tidy workspace: project paths The list of files up top isn’t too cringeworthy if you only have one project. But multiple projects or experiments in one directory results in an organizational disater… paths I like to have the following directory structure: 6.12 Working with data Let’s work with some data on the farm! A brief note: for this lesson we will not be submitting jobs to the farm’s job handler (slurm). That is because we are working with very small files. If you work on the farm during your grad school career, all of the analyses you carry out after this class should be submitted through slurm (which we will go over in our farm lesson in a few weeks!). In this lesson, we are going to be carrying out part of an experiment where we call variants with a subset of E.coli sequencing data. 6.12.1 Learning objectives subset data to test code behold the power of Github and snakemake understand how to name files 6.12.2 Testing code A great way of quickly testing to see if your code is working is by subsetting data. We can take a small chunk of a file and use it to test if our newly written code works. Let’s grab some data: mkdir -p ~/298class8/yeast/data cd !$ ln -s /home/ctbrown/data/ggg201b/SRR2584403_1.fastq.gz . ln -s /home/ctbrown/data/ggg201b/SRR2584404_1.fastq.gz . ln -s /home/ctbrown/data/ggg201b/SRR2584405_1.fastq.gz . ln -s /home/ctbrown/data/ggg201b/SRR2584857_1.fastq.gz . These files each have up to 8.5 million lines! So we’ll need smaller files to test our code. for i in SRR258*.fastq.gz do newname=$(basename $i .fastq.gz).n100000.fq zcat $i | head -100000 &gt;&gt; ${newname} done And now we have a subset of all of our fastq files! 6.12.2.1 How GitHub + snakemake + conda can make your (research) life great (This will look veeeery familiar to GGG 201(b) students :) Using GitHub, snakemake and conda together can make life a lot easier. We can grab our collaborator’s code by cloning their repo: cd ~/298class8/yeast git clone https://github.com/shannonekj/2021_ggg298_variant_calling.git cd 2021_ggg298_variant_calling then we’ll install a few more pieces of software with conda conda create -y -n fqc-day8 -c bioconda -c conda-forge samtools bcftools bwa snakemake-minimal conda activate fqc-day8 and run their Snakefile to test calling variants on the subset file. snakemake -p -j 1 In this one command we’ve done the following: * downloaded a reference genome * indexed the genome * mapped reads * aligned the sequencing data to the genome * sorted aligned reads * indexed aligned reads * called variants And now, in a single command, we have a variant.vcf file with all of the variants in the four individuals compared to the reference genome. Pretty neat huh?? (Q: why did this run so quickly?) 6.12.3 Naming files Having files with consistent names allows us to do things to them en masse and can also allow us to know what has been done to them. Everyone has a different strategy in what they like their file names to contain and how they go about naming them but here a few suggestions. 6.12.3.1 Prefixes Use the beginning of your file to your advantage. If you’ve sequenced individuals yourself, you can name these files according any or all of the following: * which individual they are from * what well in the plate they came from * the barcode/tag/library they have/were a part of * the date of sampling * which cohort they are a member of An example of this might be something like Ht_1997_A08_21_ACTGTT.fastq Where: * Ht = species ID (Hypomesus transpacificus) * 1997 = birth year * A08 = well number * 21 = plate number * ACTGTT = associated barcode Having some metadata in the file name can allow for efficient groupings when running quality controls (such as testing for batch effects). If we keep our names consistent between plates/runs could run an analysis on all individuals that were from any of these variables. 6.12.3.2 File endings The ends of files can be immensely helpful as well. Remember, at the command line, a file’s ending “.whatever” exists to inform a human what kind of file/format to expect. We can use this to our advantage by making the ends of files denote what step(s) has already taken place. Let’s look at the samtools steps that happen in our Snakefile file endings 6.13 Additional resources Bioinformatics Data Skills by Vince Buffalo Best Practices for Sci Comp (Wilson et al. 2014) Bioinformatics Curriculum Guidelines (Welch et al. 2014) "],["automating-your-analyses-and-executing-long-running-analyses-on-remote-computers.html", "7 Automating your analyses and executing long-running analyses on remote computers", " 7 Automating your analyses and executing long-running analyses on remote computers This two hour workshop will show attendees how to automate their analyses using shell scripts, as well as run and manage software that takes minutes, hours, or days to execute.

Then, describe ways to ask for help during the workshop: 1) type in Zoom chat to everyone or as a direct message to moderator/helpers (introduce helpers), 2) unmute and ask; say that we prefer participants don’t use the raised hand reaction to ask a question, since that’s used for checking in. At this point, there should be a majority of raised hands up for the survey question. Turn over the mic to the instructor. Moderator will keep track of chat questions, time (including a 5-minute break ~10:15 or 10:30am), and help share workshop resource links (i.e., section of workshop notes, exercises, post-workshop survey) Helpers aide in tracking chat questions and participation during check ins (i.e., direct message participants who have not raised their hands to make sure they’re still following along) Training team writes down typos, suggestions, etc. for the workshop and notes in the associated GitHub issue After workshop Training team updates workshop notes as needed Training coordinator emails notes, workshop recording, and post-workshop survey link to participants some time after the workshop "]]
