# Making use of on-demand “cloud” computers from Amazon Web Services

This two hour workshop will introduce attendees to AWS computer
“instances” that let you rent compute time on large or specialized
computers. We will also talk about how to estimate the compute
resources you need and measure how much you’re using.
